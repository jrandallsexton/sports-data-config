# Hangfire IngressRoutes removed for security
# TODO: Re-implement with subdomain-based routing and authentication:
#   - api-jobs.sportdeets.com/dashboard (with BasicAuth or OAuth)
#   - producer-football-ncaa.sportdeets.com/dashboard
#   - provider-football-ncaa.sportdeets.com/dashboard
# 
# Current blocker: Hangfire dashboard auth filter hard-coded to return true
# Next steps:
#   1. Fix code-level authentication in Hangfire dashboard filter
#   2. Create wildcard or specific DNS entries for job subdomains
#   3. Create Certificate for *.sportdeets.com or specific job subdomains
#   4. Create IngressRoutes with proper subdomain routing (no path rewriting needed)
#   5. Add Traefik BasicAuth middleware as additional security layer
